# Image-Captioning
Image-Captioning with using CNN(encoder) and RNN(decoder)

In this project, I build a neural network based on the following paper Attention Mechanisms
Architecture of net consists of two parts, Encoder and Decoder. Encoder serves as a feature extractor and decoder serves for generating sequences. In this project, the decoder consisted of LSTM layers with dropout.
The net was trained on captions for MS COCO dataset.
